-i need a way to signal the system that it's a new term and that it should credit all of the students' accounts with the term's CORE fees
Question: for continuing students, how do students communicate that they will be PAYING FOR THE OPTIONALS? DURING OPENING TIME ?
When a student communicates his desire to pay for the optionals, the admin will search for the student in the system and turn on the 
hot lunch option, otherwise termly accoun crediting defaults to false on optionals and credits only the core amount
    the system needs to have a clock it can refer to on a daily basis

-make sure you implement logic for changin student.current_grade when they proceed to the next level- This will be done withthe same logic that tells the systm that it's a new ter,

- POLICY:the students must be registered only when school reopens
- POLICY: the logic behind crediting and debiting a students account
	-students must be credited with the term's total amount due.  For continuing students, this function should not include items which are added to a new students amount.
	-such as the diary.
	-debiting is done by the administrattor when they make a payment to a student's account and works to offset the negative amount credited to the account
	-at the beginning of the term

	-i need to set  up a signal that goes off when it is a new term, and then credits the account again given the

- Further Recommendations-: Intergrate API to Confirm the status of a transaction
- Add payment method field in transactions

- Test whether get_term_amount() produces the correct results
- if user updates student information, adding something that alters the amount they should pay for that term, 
  the systems should be able to detect that this change has taken place and adjust the charging accordingly
- add some javascript to disable the admission button whe a user selects continuing students

- Add javascript to disable all other inputs, when a user is updating a fee structure attribute so that that only one update at a time can be done on a student
- Add javascript to disable the transport_fee input, unless the transport checkbox is checked
- After a specific period, the system will not allow any alteration of records, inorder to preserve data integrity
- Test whether he update method correctly updates the term's due amoun when student info is updated
- make receipt show you what items you have paid for and how much .(a receipt)
- use javascript to disable the charge admission_fee when a user selects continuing student
- PS: Testing is all aboout imagining the worst case scenario about the user interacting with the system and coding to reveal whether it can happen and when it does, modifying the code to  guar against it

- add javascript effect where the logo sinks in to the login form to become it's background
- login page errors change the size of the card.size of card should be fixed
- logo too plain, add piicture effects or set background color
- pages should transition out of the screen upwards, next page come in from the bottom.
- use datables for student search form
- BUG: whe transport is unselected, the form still sends bach the transport fee. FIX: when a user unselects transport, trasport_fee should be set to 0 in the backend and the transport fee box should be disabled i the frontend
- in the registration form, if transport is not selected, transport_fee should be set to 0, sounds like javascript
