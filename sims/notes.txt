-i need a way to signal the system that it's a new term and that it should credit all of the students' accounts with the term's CORE fees
Question: for continuing students, how do students communicate that they will be PAYING FOR THE OPTIONALS? DURING OPENING TIME ?
When a student communicates his desire to pay for the optionals, the admin will search for the student in the system and turn on the 
hot lunch option, otherwise termly accoun crediting defaults to false on optionals and credits only the core amount
    the system needs to have a clock it can refer to on a daily basis
