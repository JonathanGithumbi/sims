    and a 'received with thanks on behalf of kings educational centre \n you were served by xxxx'

- Testing
-i need a way to signal the system that it's a new term and that it should credit all of the students' accounts with the term's CORE fees
Question: for continuing students, how do students communicate that they will be PAYING FOR THE OPTIONALS? DURING OPENING TIME ?
When a student communicates his desire to pay for the optionals, the admin will search for the student in the system and turn on the 
hot lunch option, otherwise termly accoun crediting defaults to false on optionals and credits only the core amount
    the system needs to have a clock it can refer to on a daily basis

-make sure you implemennt logic for changin student.current_grade when they proceed to the next level

25-05-2022
- work out the 'new term' logic. in context of core fees, optionals, grade graduation etc 
- work out the logic of migrating old records into the system
- add student status{transferred, completed, continuing}
- migrting old students will be done after migrating the new ones 
- add a charge() to charge students 

27-05-2022
- Add background images on the login page from the flyer
- prevent the login page from  expanding when they receive errors on the field
-spelling error on invalid username 
- Strucutre  and style the registration form
-add age to profile info
- put contact name aand contact number on one row
- format the payment detail and the statement page

29-05-2022
- Get the system to credit accoutnts at the start of every term
- POLICY:the students must be registered only when school reopens
- POLICY: the logic behind crediting and debiting a students account
	-students must be credited with the term's total amount due.  For continuing students, this function should not include items which are added to a new students amount.
	-such as the diary.
	-debiting is done by the administrattor when they make a payment to a student's account and works to offset the negative amount credited to the account
	-at the beginning of the term

	-i need to set  up a signal that goes off when it is a new term, and then credits the account again given the 
- POLICY: MIGRATION POLICY: migrating records will be done starting from the latest year, backwards on a yearly basis
 - POLICY: RECORDS will be updated from the latest term to the previous years' terms as far back as ye

- what is the situation with diary and report book is it a yearly tthing or?

- Further Recommendations-: Intergrate API to Confirm the status of a transaction
- Add payment method field in transactions

- Test whether get_term_amount() produces the correct results
- if user updates student information, adding something that alters the amount they should pay for that term, 
  the systems should be able to detect that this change has taken place and adjust the charging accordingly
- add some javascript to disable the admission button whe a user selects continuing students


1-06-2022
- Add javascript to disable all other inputs, when a user is updating a fee structure attribute so that that only one update at a time can be done on a student
- Add javascript to disable the transport_fee input, unless the transport checkbox is checked
- After a specific period, the system will not allow any alteration of records, inorder to preserve data integrity
- Test whether he update method correctly updates the term's due amoun when student info is updated
- make receipt show you what items you have paid for and how much .(a receipt)
- use javascript to disable the charge admission_fee when a user selects continuing student
- PS: Testing is all aboout imagining the worst case scenario about the user interacting with the system and coding to reveal whether it can happen and when it does, modifying the code to  guar against it

2-06-2022
- Test whether mmigrating existing students to the systemproduce the required functionality
